Someon has pointed out a bug in the check.c code, line 169, picked up by valgrind. I've uploaded a new copy of check.c, which you may want to use for testing purposes. Most of you will probably not notice any difference. For anyone worried about potential further bugs in check.c: we will take this possibility into account during marking, so that nobody is disadvantaged by accident. (If any further issues exist, they'll be easy for us to spot, due to the sheer number of people in the unit.) Also be aware that some valgrind-reported issues may appear to be in check.c, but in reality are caused by faulty memory allocation in your code. This happens because check.c uses memory that you allocate beforehand, and unfortunately it has no way to determine whether you allocated it correctly. It is important that you resolve issues in your code reported by valgrind. You will lose marks for not doing so, and in addition, some of those issues may cause your code to fail unpredictably. Debigging your code can be difficult and stressful, but it's just as important a skill to learn as writing the code in the first place!
